# Redis Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive, stage-by-stage plan for implementing Redis features. Each stage builds upon previous knowledge and follows a hint-based learning approach.

---

## üìã Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- Basic TCP server on port 6379
- RESP protocol parsing (arrays and bulk strings)
- Commands: PING, ECHO
- Commands: SET, GET (with PX expiry)
- Commands: RPUSH, LRANGE (basic list operations)
- In-memory data storage with concurrent dictionary
- Expiry checking on GET

### üöß Next Immediate Task
- **Configure listening port**: Allow server to start on custom port via command-line argument

---

## Stage 1: Replication

Replication allows Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. Replicas automatically reconnect to masters every time the link breaks.

### 1.1 Configure Listening Port ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **YOU ARE HERE**

**Goal**: Start Redis server on a custom port specified via command-line arguments.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand command-line argument parsing in C#
- Learn about port configuration and validation
- Handle default vs custom configuration

**Tasks**:
1. Read command-line arguments (look for `--port` flag)
2. Parse and validate port number (1-65535)
3. Replace hardcoded `6379` with parsed port value
4. Test: `dotnet run -- --port 6380` should start server on 6380
5. Test: `redis-cli -p 6380 PING` should return PONG

**Hints to Consider**:
- Top-level statements have access to `args` variable
- Port validation: Must be between 1 and 65535
- Default to 6379 if no argument provided

---

### 1.2 The INFO Command

**Goal**: Implement `INFO` command to return server information.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand Redis INFO command structure
- Learn about server metadata and statistics
- Practice formatting multi-line RESP responses

**Tasks**:
1. Create an `INFO` command handler
2. Return basic server information (initially just role=master)
3. Format response as RESP bulk string
4. Support optional sections (e.g., `INFO replication`)
5. Test: `redis-cli INFO` and `redis-cli INFO replication`

**Key Information to Include**:
```
# Replication
role:master
master_replid:<40-char-alphanumeric-string>
master_repl_offset:0
```

**Hints to Consider**:
- INFO returns bulk string, not simple string
- Each line ends with `\r\n`
- Generate a random 40-character replication ID once at startup

---

### 1.3 The INFO Command on a Replica

**Goal**: Modify INFO command to return different information when server runs as replica.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand master vs replica roles
- Learn about `--replicaof` configuration
- Practice conditional response formatting

**Tasks**:
1. Parse `--replicaof <MASTER_HOST> <MASTER_PORT>` argument
2. Store master connection information
3. Modify INFO to return `role:slave` when running as replica
4. Test: `dotnet run -- --port 6380 --replicaof localhost 6379`

**Key Information to Include**:
```
# Replication
role:slave
master_host:<host>
master_port:<port>
```

**Hints to Consider**:
- Need to store whether this instance is master or replica
- Master host/port stored at startup
- Don't connect to master yet‚Äîjust store the configuration

---

### 1.4 Initial Replication ID and Offset

**Goal**: Generate and track replication ID and offset.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand replication identifiers
- Learn about replication offset tracking
- Practice generating pseudo-random strings

**Tasks**:
1. Generate a 40-character alphanumeric replication ID at startup
2. Initialize master_repl_offset to 0
3. Include these in INFO replication response
4. Store as server state (instance variables or global state)

**Hints to Consider**:
- Replication ID: 40 chars, alphanumeric (0-9, a-z)
- Can use `Random` or `Guid.NewGuid()` with transformation
- Offset starts at 0 and increments with each write command
- Masters and replicas both track their own offset

---

### 1.5 Send Handshake (1/3) - PING

**Goal**: Replica sends PING to master during initial handshake.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand TCP client connections
- Learn the replication handshake protocol
- Practice async socket communication

**Tasks**:
1. When started as replica, connect to master (TcpClient)
2. Send PING command in RESP format: `*1\r\n$4\r\nPING\r\n`
3. Wait for and validate master's response (+PONG)
4. Keep connection open for next handshake step

**Hints to Consider**:
- Create connection during server startup (if replica)
- Use TcpClient for outgoing connections
- Store master connection as persistent socket/stream
- Handle connection failures gracefully

---

### 1.6 Send Handshake (2/3) - REPLCONF listening-port

2. Format: `*3\r\n$8\r\nREPLCONF\r\n$14\r\nlistening-port\r\n$<len>\r\n<port>\r\n`
3. Wait for +OK response
4. Handle errors if master doesn't acknowledge

**Hints to Consider**:
- REPLCONF is array of 3 elements: command, subcommand, value
- Port is your server's listening port (the one clients connect to)
- Master should store replica information

---

### 1.7 Send Handshake (3/3) - REPLCONF capa psync2

**Goal**: Replica announces PSYNC2 capability to master.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand capability negotiation
- Learn about PSYNC versions
- Complete the handshake sequence

**Tasks**:
1. Send: `*3\r\n$8\r\nREPLCONF\r\n$4\r\ncapa\r\n$6\r\npsync2\r\n`
2. Wait for +OK response
3. Prepare for PSYNC command (next stage)

**Hints to Consider**:
- "capa" = capability announcement
- "psync2" = Partial Sync version 2
- This tells master what replication features replica supports

---

### 1.8 Receive Handshake (1/2) - Master Receives PING & REPLCONF

**Goal**: Master accepts and responds to replica handshake.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Implement server-side handshake handling
- Learn about replica tracking
- Practice stateful connection management

**Tasks**:
1. Add REPLCONF command handler in master
2. Handle `REPLCONF listening-port <port>` - store replica info

4. Track connected replicas (list or dictionary)
5. Return +OK for successful REPLCONF commands

**Data to Track per Replica**:
- Socket/connection
- Listening port
- Capabilities
- Current replication offset

**Hints to Consider**:

3. For first sync, return: `+FULLRESYNC <master-replid> 0\r\n`
4. Mark replica as "awaiting RDB transfer"

**Hints to Consider**:
- First sync always triggers FULLRESYNC
- Master sends its replication ID and current offset
- Replica should receive "?" as replication-id and -1 as offset for first sync
- Actual RDB transfer happens next

---

### 1.10 Empty RDB Transfer

**Goal**: Master sends empty RDB file to replica.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand RDB file format

4. Replica acknowledges completion

**Empty RDB (hex)**:
```
524544495330303131fa0972656469732d76657205372e322e30fa0a72656469732d62697473c040fa056374696d65c26d08bc65fa08757365642d6d656dc2b0c41000fa08616f662d62617365c000fff06e3bfec0ff5aa2
```

**Hints to Consider**:
- RDB sent immediately after FULLRESYNC response

4. Don't send responses back to master for propagated commands
5. Test: Verify replica has same data as master

**Hints to Consider**:
- Replica has two types of connections: master connection (receive) and client connections (serve reads)
- Need separate read loop for master connection
- Increment offset by bytes received
- Replica should execute commands but not respond to master

---

## ‚úÖ Progress Tracking

Mark tasks as you complete them:
- [ ] Task not started
- [üöß] Task in progress
- [‚úÖ] Task completed
- [üß™] Task needs testing
- [üìö] Task needs review
